# Boolean-Algebra-Simplification
This project takes the canonical form (e.g., A+CD+ABCD) of a given problem in a txt file, and first generates the truth table, then provides the minterms and maxterms in both canonical and standardÂ forms.
You must provide the input by leaving spaces between terms and plus signs. The input is read based on these spaces. Then, each row of the truth table is generated, and minterms and maxterms are written accordingly.
